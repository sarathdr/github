Git Hub sample api
====================

Url: https://peaceful-inlet-71730.herokuapp.com/

Rest api to get top 5 repo: https://peaceful-inlet-71730.herokuapp.com/user/{git-hub-handle}

Eg: https://peaceful-inlet-71730.herokuapp.com/user/sarathdr


The rest api has been developed with Spring boot and deployed to Heroku by heroku cli.

Created a heroku app and pushed ```git push heroku master``` to run it.
